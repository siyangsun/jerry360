# Ideas
### immediate features
- obstacles
	- moguls that are just little triangles
- scores that make sense
- wipe out if you land poorly, indicators that you are leaning too far (in midair for example)
- ability to switch to "goofy" if you full 180 somehow
- better movement
	- jumping should be held down and released (kinda like my springboy game but to a lesser extent)
	- flips using arrow keys; but if you don't turn all the way by the time you land you'll wipe out (lose points, lose speed, have to get up)
- turns in the course that turn the camera / orientation too

### cool aesthetic things to add soon
- character model
- particle effects / trail behind path

### blue sky
- multiple levels; alternate game modes (time trial vs. trick scoring vs. infinite survival)
- unlockable and customizable outfits / boards
- sound effects that kind of sync with the music or at least are in key
- camera can switch between 1st person and 3rd person. camera in 3rd person can move / jiggle a bit
- drones flying around jerry
