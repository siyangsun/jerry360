# TODO
- fix goofy (it is all backwards)
- rail grind should let you freely rotate your feet / body or lean
- if you tilt too hard without yaw you should wipe out

# Ideas
### immediate features
- scores that make sense
- better movement
	- jumping should be held down and released (kinda like my springboy game but to a lesser extent)
	- more realistic turn curve function

### cool aesthetic things to add soon
- character model
- indicators that you're losing balance and might wipe out

### blue sky
- multiple levels; alternate game modes (time trial vs. trick scoring vs. infinite survival)
- unlockable and customizable outfits / boards
- sound effects that kind of sync with the music or at least are in key
- camera can switch between 1st person and 3rd person. camera in 3rd person can move / jiggle a bit
- drones flying around jerry
