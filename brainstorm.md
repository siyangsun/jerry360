# Ideas
### immediate features
- obstacles
- scores that make sense
- better movement
    - jumping should be held down and released (kinda like my springboy game but to a lesser extent)
    - flips using arrow keys; but if you don't turn all the way by the time you land you'll wipe out (lose points, lose speed, have to get up)

### cool aesthetic things to add soon
- character model
- particle effects / trail behind path

### blue sky
- multiple levels; alternate game modes (time trial vs. trick scoring vs. infinite survival)
- unlockable and customizable outfits / boards
- sound effects that kind of sync with the music or at least are in key
- camera can switch between 1st person and 3rd person. camera in 3rd person can move / jiggle a bit
- drones flying around jerry
